# Developer Task - Articulate Marketing

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a task for Articulate Marketing. I chose SvelteKit as the framework because it offers a good balance between vanilla JavaScript and a full JavaScript framework. The web page is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

## Main Comments

- I implemented an **accordion** using the `<summary>` and `<details>` HTML elements to ensure the solution is both accessible and semantic.
- Images were converted to JPEG format and compressed, utilising the `<img>` `srcset` attribute for responsiveness.
- I've included **comments** throughout the codebase to explain important sections.
