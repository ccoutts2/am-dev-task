Developer Task - Articulate Marketing
Overview
This project was developed as part of a task for Articulate Marketing. I built this in SvelteKit as I believed it was a good balance between vanilla JS and a JavaScript framework. The web page is responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.


Main Comments

I opted for an accordion using the <summary> <details> HTML elements, to be as accessible and semantic as possible.
I've converted images to jpg and compressed, utilising the <img> srcset attribute, for responsiveness.

I've commented throughout the codebase, where necessary
